# CertiFy — Landing Page

A single-page, GitHub Pages–ready landing site with a left hideable menu.

## Quick Start
1. Create a new GitHub repo (e.g., `certify-site`).
2. Upload **all files** in this folder to the repo root.
3. In GitHub: Settings → Pages → Build and deployment → Deploy from branch → `main` / root.
4. Wait for Pages to publish; your site will be live at the URL GitHub shows.

## Local Preview
Just open `index.html` in your browser. No build step or server needed.

## Edit Branding
- Replace `assets/logo.svg` with your logo.
- Swap out `assets/hero.svg` / `assets/demo.svg` with screenshots.
- Update marketing copy in `index.html`.
